# Ajay — Responsive Portfolio

This is a simple responsive portfolio site built from the `asset/` folder images.

How to use

- Open `index.html` in a browser.
- Replace placeholders (email, GitHub, LinkedIn links) with real values.

Notes
- Images are referenced from the `asset/` directory already in the workspace.
